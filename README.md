# Generative AI Demonstration

This repo is intended to demonstrate how developers can get started simply with Generative AI. We will take two approaches, the first being to simply use the OpenAI API, and the second to host an LLM on AWS SageMaker. This demo is not intended to show how to train a model. 

## Setup

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
